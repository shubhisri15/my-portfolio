## Welcome to Shubhi's Portfolio source code!

Although this repository is supposed to be read-only, you can still clone it in your local repository and start tinkering around with my code. To do that, follow the steps below after cloning the repo:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## To discuss more about my work

I am extremely responsive on both LinkedIn and Email, both of which you can find on my portfolio website. But if you couldn't be bothered to go there:
