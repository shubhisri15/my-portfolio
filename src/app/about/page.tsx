          Let me make the stalking easier for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          I began my career as a Software Engineer at Atlassian India LLP, working on SaaS products in the ITSM suite. Over 4 years, I worked with cross-functional teams, picked up new tools and ways of working, and honestly â€” found it all way more refreshing than DSA.

        <p>
          The coolest part? As I grew into a Full Stack Engineer, I found myself drawn to the frontend â€” crafting clean, intuitive interfaces and thinking deeply about the user behind the screen. "5 Whys" wasn't just a process anymore, it became instinct.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started owning frontend-heavy features, focusing on accessibility, interaction design, and performance. Outside work, I doubled down on UI/UX and visual storytelling â€” blending code and creativity to build interfaces that feel effortless.

        <p>
          Fast forward to today, I'm a UX designer and frontend developer who's spent the last few months bringing her eccentric ideas to life â€” crafting responsive, user-centric experiences that balance form and function.
        </p>

        <p>
          I thrive on projects where I get to push pixels, fine-tune interactions, and bring delight to every touchpoint. So if you think what I bring to the table is what you are looking for, let's chat over coffee!
