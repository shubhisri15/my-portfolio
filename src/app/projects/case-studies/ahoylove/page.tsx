            <p>AhoyLove started out as a way for me to track my partner, who is a maritime officer and lives at sea 6+ months a year. 
                It had only been a few months since we started dating when he left for his 4 month contract, and I felt lost, flummoxed 
                by the sudden change in our communication patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would spend the entire day waiting for his one text, and track multiple websites a day just to figure out his whereabouts and his availability. 
              So to cope with this unease, I started thinking of ways to integrate all this information into a single screen, 
              and have it show up as a widget at the bottom of my laptop screen 24x7. (Yeah yeah, I know, it sounds like I am a crazy stalker.)
            </p>
            <p>
              But as I started looking into solutions trying to build my idea, I also started looking more into how other people in my situation were coping. 
              It made me realise exactly how taxing romantic relationships can be for both the seafarer and their at-home partner, even going so far as affecting their 
              careers and day-to-day functioning.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so, my tiny little single screen idea started taking the shape of a multi platform application.
            </p>
            <p>
              AhoyLove doesn't just show you your partner's info all in one place, but also allows you to strengthen your connection with 
              them in an ambient way. This product isn't yet another fancy chat app, it's your personal love journal, 
              and a way of communication that is independent of time and distance. It does not rely on their availability or their internet connectivity, 
              only on your willingness to love.

          <p>

          <p>
            Maritime relationships often suffer from emotional disconnect due to inconsistent communication,
            timezone mismatch, and a lack of ambient presence. Traditional chat apps are not designed for this
            context.

          <p>
            Building for emotional connection requires a different lens than building for functionality.
            I learned the importance of designing for &quot;presence&quot;, not just communication. User feedback
            helped me simplify, slow down UI rhythms, and add more human warmth to the product.
